1) why movement wasnt workign
python is weird, so functions cant access variables outside unless
`global userX, userY`
2) making movement better
1st thing is that it isnt normalised (ðŸ¤“)
which is fancy math word for that you can move 20% faster on diagonals cause of trig idk
so, to fix this, you make a movement a vector, then do math shit
(i also changed movement to be per tick and decoupled from events so that you dont have to spam w)
```
    pressedKeys = pygame.key.get_pressed()

    #Python lets you use true or false as equal to 1 or 0
    movementVector = (
        pressedKeys[pygame.K_d] - pressedKeys[pygame.K_a],
        pressedKeys[pygame.K_s] - pressedKeys[pygame.K_w]
    )

    #normalise ðŸ¤“

    #Pythagorous
    magnitude = math.sqrt(pow(movementVector[0], 2) + pow(movementVector[1], 2))
    #Scale the vector

    if (magnitude != 0):
        movementVector = (movementVector[0]/magnitude, movementVector[1]/magnitude)

        #Apply
        userX += movementVector[0]
        userY += movementVector[1]
```
3) fixing movement speed
since the main loop runs whenever it feels like it, its important to add a sleep timer, so that it will run at maximum 30fps (ill do 35 cause its a nicer number)
1/35 = 0.025s per frame
